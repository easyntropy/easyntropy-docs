# About

Easyntropy is a lightweight Ethereum oracle designed to be easy, flexible, and developer-friendly.

It was born out of frustration while working with existing oracle solutionsâ€”especially during a project using pyth.network and QRNG Airnode.

We kept asking ourselves: why does it have to be so complicated? Why can't we just provide an arbitrary response callback method like with pyth.network? Or why do we have to upload private keys somewhere just to use QRNG Airnode?

Originally built to support a randomness-based NFT game we were developing, Easyntropy quickly showed potential as a standalone tool that others in the community might find useful too. So instead of keeping it to ourselves, we decided to polish it up and share it.

Whether you're building games, dApps, or just need reliable randomness on-chain, Easyntropy aims to keep things simple, intuitive, and open.

cheers,

Easyntropy team
